I loved you, and that love to die refusing,
May still - who knows! Be smoldering in my breast.
Pray, be not pained -- believe me, of my choosing
I'd never have you troubled nor yet distressed.
I loved you mutely, hopelessly and truly,
With shy yet fervent, tenderness aglow;
Mine was a jealous passion and unrulyâ€¦.
May Heaven grant another loves you so!
